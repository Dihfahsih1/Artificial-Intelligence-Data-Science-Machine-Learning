ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

What is AI?
    Definition
    - Is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines especially computer systems.
    - These processes include learning, reasoning and self-correction

    Goals of AI 
        To create systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence
            Visual perception
            speech recognition
            decision-making
            language-translation

        History
            1950 -> neural Networks, 1960s -> development of algorithms, 1980s-> developed expert systems
            2000 -> ML & Big Data 

    Types of AI 
        1. Narrow AI(Weak AI)
            - AI that is designed and trained for a particular task (e.g voice assistants, recommendation systems)
        2. General AI(Strong AI)
            - The AI that has the ability to understand, learn and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks,
              similar to human intelligence
        3. Superintelligence AI:
            - Its hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence and capabilities.


        AI vs ML vs DL
        - AI is a broad field encompassing any technique that enables machines to mimic the HI
        - ML is a subset of AI that involves use of algorithms to learn and make predictions based on the data 
        - DL is a subset ML that uses neural Networks with many layers to analyze various factors of data

    AI Subfields

    1. Natural Language Processing(NLP)
            - techniques for understanding and generating human language
            - applications: Chatbots, sentiment analysis, language translation, speech recognition 

    2. Computer Vision
            - technique for enabling machines to interprete and make decisions based on visual data. 
            applications: image and video recognition, self-driving cars and medical imaging

    3. Robotics
            - The design and creation of robots that can perform tasks autonomously
             applications- Manufacturing robots, autonomous drones, household robots

    4. Expert Systems:
            - Ai systems that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert.
            Components of expert systems: knowledge base, inference engine, user interface.

            Applications: Medical diagnosis systems, financial forecasting.
