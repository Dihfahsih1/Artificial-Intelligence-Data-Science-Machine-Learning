ML: 
    Sub set of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models
    enabling computers to perform specific tasks without instructions(Human intervention)

    Involves training a model on a data set to make predictions or decisions based on new data


Key Concepts ML 
    - Supervised Learning(SL)
    - Unsupervised Learning(USL)
    - Reinforced Learning

1. SL -> Model is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training is paired with an output label
    Types 
        - Regression SL -> Predicting continuous output(The prices of sugar)
        - Classification -> Predicting a discrete output(e.g spam detection in emails)
    Examples 
        - Linear Regression
        - Logistics regression
        - support vector machines(Regressor)
        - decision trees
        - random forests 
        - neural Networks

2. USL ->  The model is trained on data without labeled responses. 
           The system tries to learn the patterns and the structure from the data

        Types
            - Clustering: Grouping data points into clusters
            - Association: Discovering rules that describe large portions of data.

        Examples:
            - K-means clustering 
            - Mechanical Clustering 
            - Principal Component analysis(PCA)
            - Apriori algorithm

K-means -> algorithm used for clustering, data that has nearest mean

STEPS
- Initialize centroids(K)
- Assigning Clusters
- Update clusters 
- repeat(2,3)

Advantages
- Works well with separated data
- Efficient on large dataset
- Easy and simple to implement 
- 
Disadvantages
- Requires specifying large clusters
- It sensitive to the position of data
- It assumes that your data is similar in size

PCA  -> Is a reduction technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset
    - It transforms data into a new coordinated system

STEPS
- Standardize the data (subtract the mean and divide by std for each feature)
- Calculate Matrix
- Compute the values and vectors
- sort values and vectors
- project the data






3. Reinforcement Learning 
    - Is a type of ML where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions
      in an environment with aim of a cummulative reward

    Key concepts in RL 
    - Agent: Learner or Decision maker
    - Environment: External system with which the agent interacts with
    - State: Representation of current situation of the agent
    - Action: These are possible moves an agent can make
    - Reward: The feedback from the environment based on the action the agent has taken
    - Policy(PI): This is the strategy the agent uses or employs to determine
      the next action based on the current state
    - Value Function(V): A function that estimates the expected cummulative reward
      of taking action from a given data

    Types of RL
    1. Model-free RL 
    2. Model-Based RL 

    Algorithms Used in RL 
    - Q-Learning 
    - Deep Q-Networks(DQN)
    - Policy Gradient Methods 
    - Actor-Critic Methods
