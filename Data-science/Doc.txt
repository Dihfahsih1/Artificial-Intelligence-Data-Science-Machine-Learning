Data Science:
- This is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, process,
  algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured
  and unstructured data(this involves data collection, cleaning, analyze and vizualisation)

Python in Data Science
    -Widely used because of simplicity, readability
     and availability of powerful and free packages(libraries)
     
     libraries
     1. Pandas -> Data Manipulation and Analysis.
     2. Numpy ->  For numerical operations
     3. Matiplotlib -> Data Visualization
     4. Scipy -> Data computation
     5. Jupyter Notebook -> For analysis and data Visualization

Machine Learning
    ML is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models
    that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions based on the given data

    Python  for Machine Learning
    - A variety of frameworks and libraries
      1. Scikit-learn: for general machine learning
      2. Tensorflow -> Deep learning

Artificial Intelligence(AI)
    This is a broad field that involves the simulation or resemblance of human intelligence 
    This includes the following processes
    - Learning 
    - Reasoning
    - Problem Solving 
    - Perception
    - Language understanding

    libraries
    1. PyTorch -> Neural Networks and Deep learning
    2. Tensorflow
    3. openCV
    4. NLTK -> Natural Language Processing
